This tool should systematicly walk you through the repair process running the nessessary tools to repair your Windows machine.

# Obtaining the programs

The best way to download SysRepair is by using the github zip feature. Alternatvely, you can use the git tools suite to keep up to date with the latest updates.


# First time configuration:

Find Run_SysRepair.cmd in the SysRepair folder and open it in your text editor or IDE, and find where the script mentions "PATHTOYOUR.ps1FILEHERE". Replace this path with the path to the SysRepair.ps1 file, and keep the quotatoion marks in place. Save the file and run the script in a non-elevated mode. If you see an error message like "You must be a admin to run this script", you have done it correctly and the script is ready to use. If you get a "This file cannot be found" error, you may have done this step wrong.
